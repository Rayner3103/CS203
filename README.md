# TARIFF  
**Trade Agreements Regulating Imports and Foreign Fees**

**Demo: http://104.208.65.235:3000/**

## 📌 Project Vision  
TARIFF is a system designed to manage and calculate **import tariffs and fees** based on a product's **country of origin/destination, brand, price, and category**.  
It is tailored for the **Technology Sector**, focusing on trade-related data management and tariff calculations.
